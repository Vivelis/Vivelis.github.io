# Welcome to my Portfolio !

I introduce myself, my name is Macéo JALBERT and I am a young computer science student.  
I am passionate about computers and new technologies.  
Since I was little, I like to understand how everything around me works. It is with this curiosity that I fell on computer science.  
It is an incredible universe full of resources, it allows you to create what you want as long as you know where to look and that you are persistent.
